# Project Overview

This React.js application is a user query search tool that enables users to filter and display data in a table format. The mock data is generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/), and the user can perform queries based on the first name, last name, and gender columns. All the rows are displayed initialy when user is yet to make a query.

## **Features**

### 1. First Name Filter
- Users can type a substring in the text area, and the application filters and displays only the rows where the first name column matches the typed string.

### 2. Last Name Filter
- Similar to the first name filter, users can type a substring in the text area to filter and display rows where the last name column matches the typed string.

### 3. Gender Filter
- Users can select a gender from the dropdown menu, and the application filters and displays rows where the gender column matches the selected option.
